_Please note that there are python modules which can compute simplex method and are much more vetted sources of 
Linear optimization_.
This was simply made as my version of notes and interesting way to play around with the simplex method in python and many modules were intended to be abstracted but may require modification for proper use.

Linear Programming Python Program based on APM236 at UofT

## Examples
Please see [main.py](LPPy/main.py) for examples on how this code can be used.

## Notes
Please note that this program is very basic and was not intended to be used as a module for linear programming problems
in real-world applications, more as a tool to understand the properties behind linear programming problems. 
Moreover, the program is not complete and will be added to as lectures progress. If anyone would like to help
contribute please feel free to fork the repository and create modifications.

## Documentation
Once again, this program was simply a sandbox for LPP, thus some of the documentation and code structure may not 
follow clean architecture principles and requires modification to be considered a clean program.
